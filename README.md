# ESPHome

### What is ESP Home?
ESP Home is a general framework for controlling an IoT (internet of things) device from mobile.

### How does it work?
ESP Home App uses your JavaScript files to connect and control the interface. You design sections, rows and their types, then control them from JavaScript. All design tasks can be done on this web site in user area. ESP Home hosts your data and JavaScript files. Once you logged into the App, your files will be synchronized with the server and when you select a device on the list in app, JavaScript of that device will be run and starts working. You connect to the real device for API commands from within JavaScript files.
